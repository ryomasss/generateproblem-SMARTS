# Tasks: Standardize Reaction Conditions

## Implementation - Data Normalization
- [ ] Audit Alkene reactions in `reactions.js` and update conditions.
- [ ] Audit Alkyne reactions and update conditions.
- [ ] Audit Benzene reactions and update conditions.
- [ ] Audit Alcohol/Acid/Carbonyl reactions and update conditions.

## Implementation - UI Refinement
- [ ] Update `ui-controller.js` to hide the reaction name (`problem-type`) by default, showing it only when "Show Answer" is toggled.

## Verification
- [ ] Verify that arrow text now shows chemical reagents (e.g., $Br_2$).
- [ ] Verify that problem title is hidden initially to prevent spoilers.
- [ ] Ensure subscripts in conditions are readable.
